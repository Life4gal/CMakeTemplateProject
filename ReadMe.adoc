== Introduction

This project can be used as a startup template for any project.

The project currently contains the following dependencies:

- link:cpm/CPM.cmake[CPM]
- link:3rd-party/fmtlib.cmake[fmtlib]
- link:3rd-party/spdlog.cmake[spdlog]
- link:3rd-party/boost-ext-ut.cmake[boost-ext-ut]
- link:3rd-party/eve.cmake[eve]

We use link:https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake[CPM] as our third-party library management tool.

link:https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt[fmtlib]
is an open-source formatting library providing a fast and safe alternative to C stdio and C++ iostreams.

link:https://github.com/gabime/spdlog[spdlog]
Very fast, header-only/compiled, C++ logging library.

link:https://github.com/boost-ext/ut[UT]
C++20 Î¼(micro)/Unit Testing Framework

link:https://github.com/jfalcou/eve[eve]
is a reimplementation of the old EVE SIMD library by Falcou et al. which for a while was named Boost.SIMD. It's a C++20 and onward implementation of a type based wrapper around SIMD extensions sets for most current architectures. It aims at showing how C++20 can be used to design and implement efficient, low level, high abstraction library suited for high performances.

Among them, only `CPM` is a must-dependency, and the other third-party libraries are only for demonstration purposes.
footnote:[Of course, if you have other third-party libraries management tools, you can also not use `CPM`.]

== Requirements

- [*] CMake. (The higher, the better)
- [*] CXX Compiler. (Support CXX20 and above, depending on your needs)
- [*] Already champing at the bit.
